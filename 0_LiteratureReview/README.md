  - **[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15271277/)**
  - **Objective**: cost-saving classification approach using 43 predictive variables for 5-year hip fracture risk with equivalent diagnostic utility as the use of a robust optimum classification rule 
  - **Methods**: generation of a cost-saving classification rule and conduction of a validation study
  - **Outcomes**: cost-saving classification rule is statistically non-inferior to the robust optimum classification rule
  - **Relation to the Project**: hints for variable selection based on variable importance, theoretical background on variables and decision making
